Considering I'm currently at East River and need to get to La Guardia Airport, cutting through Midtown seems like an efficient option.

But considering the suggestion, taking the 2 train to Times Square could be an option if I want to experience the city's energy.

However, considering the suggestion, if we were to go to Rockefeller Center, it would make more sense to go there after reaching a more central location. From JFK Airport, taking a direct route to Harlem or a central location like Times Square might be more efficient. But, evaluating the idea of going to a lively area before heading to Harlem, I think going to Times Square or a similar central area could be beneficial.

However, a more direct approach might be to take the subway that directly connects to the Bronx. I recall that the 4 train goes from Brooklyn to the Bronx. A likely transfer point would be at Union Square or 59th Street - Columbus Circle. From Brooklyn College, taking the 2 or 3 train to 59th Street - Columbus Circle then transferring to the A or C train doesn't seem optimal.
